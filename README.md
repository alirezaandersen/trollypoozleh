# Puzzlenary aka Trolly Poozleh

Development Team: Claudia Kiesenhofer, Kris Foss, and Alireza Andersen


Trolly Poozleh is a concept our team created based on the classic game whack-a-mole and our team member's collective love of puzzles.  We created it to learn more about JavaScript and node.js.  The object of the game is to clear all off the pictures of the puzzle in each level by clicking the green squares.  Each level has more tiles than the previous level and more forbidden colors that take away lives.  Each level has three lives and you must clear the puzzle before you lose all three lives.  


It is built off of a starter kit.  To run the code on your machine follow the steps below:

To install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To fire up a development server:

```
npm start
```

Once the server is running, you can visit:

* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` to run your application.
* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/test.html` to run your test suite in the browser.

To build the static files:

```js
npm run build
```

To run tests in Node:

```js
npm test
```
